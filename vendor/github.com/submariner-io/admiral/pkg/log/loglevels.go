	//        not being an error, is important information and helpful to be in the
	//        logs, eg:
	//          * startup information

	//          * re-connections/disconnections

	// DEBUG : used to provide logs for often occurring events that could be helpful
	//        for debugging errors.

	//         which generally would be less useful for debugging but can be useful
	//         in some cases, for example tracing function entry/exit, parameters,
